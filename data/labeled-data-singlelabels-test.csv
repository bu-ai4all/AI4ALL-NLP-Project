280,"Hello . I am a teacher at a Montessori middle school in Norwalk , Connecticut . Our students are carrying out a few storm relief initiatives at school , including one that is rather impractical , but hopefully , spiritually uplifting ! Our students are making their own cheery , encouraging labels for something like 1,500 chocolate bars , which they would like to deliver personally to the storm victims of Staten Island . We have not yet figured out the logistics of this and I wonder if you could give us some direction . We are hoping to come as a small group on Sunday for a few hours to try to spread some `` sweetness '' and to let Staten Islanders know that they may feel alone , but they are not ! Is there a place that you could direct us to in order to fulfill our mission ? Thank you for advising ... . ******************",Food,resource
